### What is CSS and what makes it special

CSS, along with the web standards movement in the early 2000s really helped to push the web it a domain that wasn't infuriating. You didn't have to download a gigantic and inflexible file just to render a nice looking page, you could change the styling considerably with just one file.

You could write the structure for your page, the HTML, in a particular way and use CSS to breath life into it and when it looked a mess you could just rewrite it.

That was a partly unfulfilled promise, you couldn't write the HTML anyway you wanted to. Source order was still important, particularly for accessibility.

Around the sametime javascript was evolved into more than just a toy but like CSS it was a very frustrating experience. Which is why tools like jQuery emerged to smoother over the language and browser problems.

This never really happened with CSS, you had to use a series of design specific hacks to fill browser quirks.

HTML5 to the rescue.

Why was it so bad?

* no variables
* no functions
* probably not reusable

* Tables
