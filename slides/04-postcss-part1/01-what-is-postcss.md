### <img src="../assets/logos/PostCSS_Logo.svg" height="90" class="plain vmiddle" /> What is PostCSS?

* A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript
* A set of APIs to enable a plugin ecosystem
* Not useful on it's own

<aside class="notes">
Initially confusing due to the name, it's not a post-processor, or pre-processor. It's a css processor.

Post in the sense it was a reaction to what already exists, in this case it was Rework, not Sass.

It's a little like gulp.
