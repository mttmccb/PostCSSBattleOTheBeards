<aside class="notes">
That's why pre-processing tools like Sass emerged you could start to split up your giant stylesheet into partial views, use function to generate some of your rules, nest rules.

This really helped get you towards more maintainable code, until you come to debugging it and realised some of the rules it produced were horrific and difficult to unpick.

TJ Holowaychuk (created ExpressJS) also created Rework and Stylus
