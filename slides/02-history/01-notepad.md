### I ❤️ Notepad

* Notepad was the tool of choice
  * View Source, so you can remember which doctype
  * Apply CAPS LOCK
  * LOTS OF `<FONT/>` TAGS!
    * Deprecated in 1998! Supported in 2017

  In many case there was only HTML and images, images that loaded oh so slowly.
  For the the first half of that time the majority of the web was "under construction".

  Currently I'm a web developer at a startup and get to use tools I could not have dreamed of.

  They're not perfect and they're often overengineered but a common theme in my career has been a heavy dose of pragmatism.
