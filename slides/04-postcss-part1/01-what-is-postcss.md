* A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript
* A set of APIs to enable a plugin ecosystem
* Not useful on it's own

- Fork of Rework
- Initially confusing due to the name
- It's a css processor.
- Post in the sense it was a reaction to what already exists,
- In this case it was Rework, not Sass.
- It's a little like gulp.
- Ian Curtis, Tina Weymouth (Talking Heads), Mogwai, Sigur Ros, At the Drive and Nickelback
