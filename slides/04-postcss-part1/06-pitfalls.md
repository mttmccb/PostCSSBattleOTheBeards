### Oh FFS...

When I first started with PostCSS I found a library that covered the majority of what I was looking for. So I dropped in an issue. Use PostCSS, it's really easy!

I've since learned that Sass and PostCSS are a bit different and even with the plugins it's not a quick job to cover an existing Sass project.

The biggest thing I learned was that order is important.

Next is don't over do the number of plugins.

Some plugins work better together.

Converting existing projects

Sass-like is not worth the effort
